## Overview
The goal of this project was to create a full stack chat application using the MERN Stack that would allow users to recieve messages in realtime

## Challenges
- The biggest challenge of this project was incorporating the socket.io package into a full stakc mern application. There wasnt too many tutorials or articles on using socket.io with the mongoDB database plus react.
- To solve this issue, I had to spend a lot of time reading through the socket.io documentation to and going through a iterative process of breaking and fixing many bugs. 
- I used socket-io-client and socket-io in tandem to get them to link up.
